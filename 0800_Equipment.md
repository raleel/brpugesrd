# **8. Equipment**

This chapter covers everything outside of your character: items that they can own and interact with, such as money, weapons, armor, equipment, vehicles, and the environment itself, mundane or exceptional. Here also are rules for special types of gear and how to handle equipment in play.

**Money**

**Wealth** addresses money, but is abstracted due to the potential range of prices, incomes, and currencies throughout any possible setting. In place of currency exchange lists or currency abstractions, the Wealth and Status rules in *Chapter 2: Characters* and *Chapter 3: Skills* are used. For convenience, these are summarized on the Wealth Levels table (opposite).

The **Item Value** column represents the value of items available to a character of that Wealth level. *Cheap* items are worth very little, *Inexpensive* equipment is cheap and usually low-quality, *Average* equipment is of sound quality and costs a fair price, while *Expensive* gear is higher-quality or more pricey. *Priceless* items and equipment are considered to be above what can be easily purchased: buying these must be arranged or negotiated, even among the wealthy.

Two additional values are not represented on this chart: Free and Restricted. *Free* items are just that—they cost nothing and can be found without effort, while *Restricted* items are unavailable without a permit and and unauthorized ownership often incurs criminal charges. Restricted items may be given an actual value in addition to the quality, such as an item that is Expensive as well as being Restricted.

Character creation provides information about your character’s beginning Wealth level. Your gamemaster may use this and the Status skill as guidelines for assigning starting equipment above and beyond those guidelines presented in **Step Eight** of character creation.

**Wealth levels**

| **Wealth Level** | **Item Value** | **Description**                                                                                                       |
|------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Wealthy          | Priceless      | Vast wealth, wanting for nothing. Any purchase is within reason and lines of credit allow for even greater financing. |
| Affluent         | Expensive      | Well-off and able to spend freely without concern for budget.                                                         |
| Average          | Average        | A middle-class income, comfortable, but not extravagant. Major purchases are weighed carefully.                       |
| Poor             | Inexpensive    | Life on the edge. Day-to-day sustenance is meager and any loss has consequences.                                      |
| Destitute        | Cheap          | Penniless, without even basic pocket money. Survival is a driving concern.                                            |

**Equipment**

Each piece of equipment has a relative value. Your gamemaster should assume that if your character is of that Wealth level (or above), they have access to that piece of equipment without any trouble. Your character has free access to equipment with values below their Wealth level, within reason. Your gamemaster may require Status rolls if you wish for your character to reach above their station and possess items of higher Wealth level. This can represent saving up for something, a valuable hand-me-down, or calling in a favor.

At your gamemaster’s discretion, if you wish for your character to possess more expensive gear (above their Wealth level), a successful Status roll should be required to ‘purchase’ items one level above your character’s default Wealth level. A Difficult Status roll must be made for items two Wealth levels above, and your gamemaster may rule that items more than two levels of value above your character’s default Wealth level are simply inaccessible. Alternately, your gamemaster may decide that a particular piece of equipment has been given, assigned, or loaned to the character, based on the character’s profession.

**For example,** *a soldier’s Wealth level is usually Poor or Average, but soldiers are issued firearms and equipment far above their financial means. A soldier is expected to take care of the equipment and may not ‘own’ it, but the gear is available for adventuring. However, an astronaut is unlikely to own their own spaceship outside of a science fiction setting.*

**When to Describe Equipment?**

When does a piece of equipment need to be described in game terms, versus when it can be assumed to be a part of the background? This is a question of detail: when are game effects required, and when are they unnecessary? Though this decision is for your gamemaster, there is no right or wrong answer: merely the degree of convenience. Ideally, the time spent figuring game specifics is minimized in favor of maximizing time for roleplaying and adventuring.

This chapter covers a variety of pieces of equipment, including weapons, armor, and vehicles. Ideally, these guidelines are thorough enough that an equivalent to some other piece of equipment can be derived, or a piece of gear can be abstracted into a straightforward skill modifier.

**Starting Equipment**

As noted in **Step Eight** of *Chapter 2: Characters*, your character begins with gear and equipment appropriate to their Wealth level and profession. Usually, an average character will have:

-   A complete set of clothing appropriate to their environment and genre.
-   Pocket money and personal savings appropriate to their Wealth level.
-   A personal item showing some relation to their family, whether an heirloom, keepsake, photo, etc., or some trinket of little relative value but having some emotional connection.
-   Any trade tools or equipment suitable to their profession, if appropriate.
-   Any weapon in which they have a skill of over 50%, if appropriate.

Each profession may have additional gear, such as the pilot, who may begin play with an airplane, ship, or even a spaceship, based on the setting. Try not to choose a profession solely for the access to equipment—your profession should be a part of the character you want to play, not the most advantageous social or economic choice.

**For example,** *if everyone in the group picks a noble, game play might become stale if all the characters use their vast financial resources to make problems go away.*

Furthermore, you and your gamemaster should consider that the quality and appearance of your character’s gear and garments are also likely to reflect their Status skill ranking and Wealth.

**For example,** *a student’s garments are clean and probably fashionable, but not suitable for black-tie events, and serve them poorly on an expedition into remote Tibet. The gear a dilettante purchases for a hunting expedition is pristine and of the best brands, though an experienced hunter has well-worn and trustworthy gear chosen for reliability over the label.*

**Purchasing Equipment**

When your character wants to obtain or replace equipment or gear that they cannot scrounge, loot, or take from someone, this is handled using the item’s assigned value, and potentially using skills such as Appraise, Bargain, and Persuade, or by simply using Status rolls as appropriate.

First, determine whether the equipment can be found at all. Your gamemaster may require a successful Research roll or a characteristic roll such as Idea, Luck, or Knowledge to find it. Communication skills may be required if bargaining or negotiation is necessary. *Chapter 10: Settings* provides some basic guidelines for availability of items in a variety of settings.

Assuming the desired item can be found, the most direct way to get it is with the Status skill, modified by these factors:

-   If the item has value two levels below your character’s Wealth level and it can be found, it is automatically available. No roll is needed.
-   If the item has value one level below your character’s Wealth level and it can be found, a single item (or a small set of items, as appropriate) can be had without making a roll.
-   If the item has value equal to your character’s Wealth level, no roll is required to obtain it.
-   If the item is one value level above your character’s Wealth level, a successful Status roll is required to obtain it.
-   If the item is two value levels above your character’s Wealth level, a successful *Difficult* Status roll is required to obtain it.
-   If the item is more than two value levels above your character’s Wealth level, no Status roll will obtain it.

Finally, there’s always theft or violence to get a desired piece of gear. If your gamemaster permits, your character may begin play with a stolen item of almost any value. In this case, determine who owned the item originally, whether they know it has been taken (and who took it), and the degree and severity of the resources they will devote to recovering it. The theft itself may be roleplayed as an introductory scene or flashback, or automatically assumed to have been successful. In either case, your gamemaster should make any reasonable efforts to deal with the repercussions of the theft in a manner appropriate to the setting, potentially including the recovery efforts into the overall story or campaign. As with other skills, a successful skill roll made before an adventure begins is not eligible for an experience check.

**Starting Equipment with Powers**

You may wish for your character to begin with a piece of powered equipment, if powers are used in the setting. If your gamemaster approves, your character must ‘pay’ for that piece of equipment out of their own starting budget for powers, whether in initial spells or psychic abilities, at the cost of a mutation, or out of your character’s power budget. You may begin with one or more pieces of equipment that utilize powers, with the following guidelines:

-   **Magic Powers:** To begin play with a magic item, your character must sacrifice 1 point of permanent POW per spell invested in the item, plus 1 point of permanent POW per level of spell capacity the item can use. Additionally, your character must know (or have access to) the spell(s) the item can use. The item has a power point capacity equal to your character’s normal power point total after the magic item is created, or the SIZ of the item. If your character did not create the magic item, your gamemaster should determine its power point capacity. A magic item must have an initial skill rating paid for out of your character’s personal skill points, and cannot be higher than the skill rating of its creator. If your character did not create it, your gamemaster should determine the initial skill ratings. When the magic item is created, determine whether it is personal (only your character can use it), whether it must be defeated in a power point vs. power point resistance roll if it has power points, or if anyone can use it. See Magic Items for more information.
-   **Mutations:** To begin with an item with mutations, work with your gamemaster to provide a reasonable explanation why such an item exists and what mutations are best to represent its abilities. The mutated item is a part of your character and must be paid for out of their initial characteristic and available mutations. To begin play with a mutated item, your character must sacrifice 1 point of permanent CON per level of the mutation (and an equal number of available starting mutations). Any characteristic rolls the item makes are based off your character’s own characteristics. A mutated item is considered to be ‘alive’ and will heal at the same rate your character does. See **Mutated Items** for more information.
-   **Psychic Abilities:** To begin with an item that uses psychic abilities, your character must sacrifice 1 point of permanent POW per level of the psychic ability (and one psychic ability ‘slot’ from their starting psychic abilities if the ability is not known). The item has a starting POW (and maximum power points) equal to your character’s. Your character must pay the skill points for the item’s psychic abilities out of their personal skill point pool. See **Equipment with Psychic Abilities** for more information.
-   **Sorcery:** To begin play with an artifact, your character must sacrifice 1 point of permanent POW per sorcery spell invested in the artifact and must know (or have access to) the spell(s) the artifact can use. The artifact has a power point reservoir equal to your character’s normal power point maximum (after the artifact is created), whichever is larger. Your gamemaster should set the POW and power point value if the artifact was not created by your character. When the artifact is created, you should determine whether it will be personal (only your character can use it), whether it must be defeated in a power point vs. power point resistance roll if it has power points, or if anyone can use it. See **Equipment with Sorcery** for more information.
-   **Superpowers:** To begin play with a gadget, pay for the gadget’s powers as if they are from your character’s own power budget. It is recommended that the gadget be the same power level as its owner, though your gamemaster may allow for a gadget more or less powerful. Your gamemaster can also decide to shift the relative level of the gadget and your character for balance purposes, so if the gadget is a level higher than the campaign power level, your character’s power level should be shifted one level down, or vice versa. You can take the power failing “Superpowered identity must be turned on in an obvious and preventable manner” tied to the item, usually a +1 power budget bonus. Other power failings may apply, such as “Power has a limited number of uses per day”. Also, your gamemaster may allow you to take a new power failing: “Power comes from a gadget” for a +1 power budget bonus. Whenever applicable, the gadget should rely on your character’s relevant skill. See **Equipment with Superpowers** for more information.

**Making Equipment**

Your character may want to actually build a piece of equipment, which is usually cheaper than buying it and less risky than stealing it. Any item your character makes (as opposed to buying) is considered to be one value level lower than its standard price. This assumes that your character is skilled in the manufacture of the item (a relevant skill rating of 75%+). This assumes that your character knows where to find trustworthy components at good prices (black market, mail order, salvage yard, etc.), and will spend the time testing and evaluating materials to make sure they work. Your gamemaster may require that this process involve other skill rolls, or even Status rolls as above. The time and effort spent gathering parts and/or raw materials is up to your gamemaster to determine, based on how much they want to focus on it during play.

Some items cannot traditionally be fashioned from store-bought pieces, such as duplicating unique pieces of art or artifacts as anything but replicas. Though the individual pieces may be cheap to make or find, the craftsmanship or item’s rarity may limit your options. If your character is not skilled enough, or fails the relevant rolls, the cost of raw materials and components may even be more expensive than the item traditionally is.

**For example,** *attempting to build a car out of pieces purchased through retail is time-consuming and expensive, and much more money and time than just buying a car outright. However, if your character is skilled and is able to use Bargain and Research successfully, their may find a junkyard or be able to scavenge all of the necessary elements for much cheaper than paying asking price.*

Ultimately, it is up to your gamemaster to decide how much time it takes to manufacture a particular item. If necessary, assuming that all required equipment is on hand and all relevant skill rolls are successful: an item that is relatively simple to make requires one hour per SIZ. If it is of average complexity, each SIZ requires one day. If it is relatively complex, each SIZ is one week. If it is extremely complex, each SIZ may take a month. If more than one character is working on the item, divide the SIZ between them. When the work has covered the required SIZ of the item, it is complete. Use the SIZ equivalency tables.

**For example,** *a target shield (SIZ 3) is relatively easy to construct and takes three hours. A SIZ 50 automobile is of average complexity and takes a single person 50 days of work or two mechanics 25 days of work to assemble from pieces. A SIZ 110 airliner, however, is extremely complex, and would take a single character nine years to complete. Your gamemaster is encouraged to modify these amounts based on equipment, facilities, and the quality of successes rolled. For such a long-term project, each time period (one hour, one day, or one week) requires a separate and successful skill roll, if a skill roll is necessary.*

These values are abstract, and your gamemaster is encouraged to provide more accurate information on manufacturing time, if desired.

**Equipment Quality Modifiers**

Skill rolls can be modified by having relevant and appropriate equipment handy. Equipment can be anything from a set of lockpicks, a machinist’s tool set, a research library, a medical lab, or anything else that is useful and appropriate. The quality of equipment can provide a modifier to a skill roll, as described in \*\* Situational Modifiers\*\*. This modifier can range from inferior equipment penalizing your character’s skill rating by –20%, to superior quality equipment offering a +20% bonus.

Most types of equipment exist in a wide variety of qualities. Your gamemaster should determine whether a particular piece of equipment is available in a range of qualities and how easy or expensive it may be to obtain said equipment. Most equipment your character uses is by default of average quality. However, you may wish for your character to own or use superior quality equipment, to increase their chances of success with a relevant skill roll.

Following is a quick guide to handling value and availability of different quality levels of equipment:

| **Quality** | **Modifier** | **Value and Abilty**               |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------------------|
| Inferior    | –20%         | Subtract one to three value levels |
| Average     | None         | As normal                          |
| Superior    | +20%         | Add one to three value levels      |

To use this chart, find the piece of equipment’s normal value (or consult your gamemaster). Next, determine the quality of the item you would like for your character. Consult the **Value and Ability** column to determine the final value of the equipment. A piece of equipment’s value and availability cannot usually be modified beyond normal limits. Assumedly, your character wants good or superior equipment to increase their skill ratings, though if budget is an issue, you may choose to have your character use more affordable lower-quality equipment.

At your gamemaster’s discretion, alternate values and/or modifiers can be assigned to equipment—the values presented are guidelines.

Having adequate gear provides no modifier at all. However, if your character does not possess the required equipment to use a particular skill, your gamemaster may make the skill’s chance *Difficult* or *Impossible*, or simply rule that the skill cannot be attempted without the right gear.

**For example,** *your character encounters a lock that must be picked. Following are some of the outcomes due to circumstances:*

-   *Superior lock picks and other tools provide a +20% bonus.*
-   *Average tools provide no bonus.*
-   *Inferior tools (rusty, broken, improvised) modified the skill by –20%.*

*Your gamemaster may declare that the skill cannot be attempted at all if your character does not have even the most rudimentary lockpicking tools. They may say“You can’t pick the lock without a lockpick, or anything to stick in the lock. Maybe look around some more? You might find something to fashion into an improvised lockpick.”*

*Your gamemaster may allow your character a straight 1% chance of success, even without tools. If the roll is successful, your gamemaster may say: “You manage to wiggle the lock assembly back and forth until you hear a slight click. Either you managed to unlock it through applying the right vibrations, or it wasn’t locked correctly in the first place. Either way, it was amazing luck.”*

Remember that situational modifiers to a skill rating are applied after an *Easy* modifier doubles it or *Difficult* divides it in half.

**Skills and Equipment**

Many skills require equipment to be used successfully, or are greatly enhanced with equipment. As noted before, some skills are penalized for having no equipment. The equipment needed for a particular skill varies by setting, and your gamemaster may provide more details this topic. The **Skills & Equipment** table describes potential specialized or general equipment to use with skills. If the skill is not listed, it does not require any equipment, or it is obvious (such as weapon skills).

**Other Equipment** contains additional information on useful equipment, including sample kits your character might use.

**Equipment with Characteristics**

Some equipment has characteristic values: whether values in all the characteristics, some, or only one. Some have none. This varies item to item, but if an item has a quality requiring a resistance roll, it should have a characteristic value. For equipment with characteristics, the following guidelines describe how these values work when applied to objects:

-   **Strength (STR):** An item with STR must have some means of motion. STR is not a measure of how resistant something is to STR: for that value, see its hit point or armor value. Items with STR are vehicles, construction equipment like forklifts or bulldozers, robots, or even hydraulic jacks.
-   **Constitution (CON):** An item with CON is rare—hit point totals are usually based on raw SIZ and modified by armor value. Unless it can heal or is affected by disease, poison, etc. it doesn’t require CON. Sample items with CON would be humanoid androids.
-   **Size (SIZ):** SIZ is the primary characteristic for an item—almost everything has physical presence and therefore SIZ. As noted above, for most pieces of gear, SIZ determines hit point values. Sometimes an item will have greater hit points, based on what it is made of. See **General Qualities of Objects** for more on hit points, armor value, and other attributes.
-   **Intelligence (INT):** Rare for an item, INT represents thought, implying intuition and problem-solving. INT is unlikely for items other than computers or artificial intelligences, but magic items might have INT and attendant personalities. An item with INT should ideally have some means of communicating, such as a display, screen, voice, telepathy, or other method of relaying information.
-   **Power (POW):** POW represents spiritual energy, and is almost exclusive to living beings or magical creations. This does not represent a power source—that is either mechanical (a power point reserve) or using the Extra Energy superpower.
-   **Dexterity (DEX):** Any item capable of independent movement should have DEX. If an item with DEX must be operated by your character, use the lower DEX of either your character or the item.
-   **Charisma (CHA):** While CHA has elements of personality and personal charisma included, for an item it can either be the aesthetic appeal, or it may represent that the item is capable of communication and charm. The main reason to assign CHA to an inanimate item is to compare its appearance to another item.
-   **Education (EDU) (Option):** Aside from representing training or downloaded knowledge for a thinking computer, EDU is best used for equipment with knowledge reserves. Usually such an item either adds a bonus to your character’s Research skill, or can make skill rolls *Easy* or *Difficult*. When assigned to an item, EDU stands for data it has immediate access to. This figure expands dramatically with the advent of information storage and online access to databases.

As noted above, it isn’t essential for each piece of equipment or item to have characteristics unless they’re needed. If in the course of play, you need a value that hasn’t been defined, generate it with a roll of an appropriate number of D6s or assign it a value based on similar pieces of equipment.

You could even determine the value with a Status roll: a fumble is a value of 1, a failure equals 1D6, a success equals 2D6, a special success is 2D6+6, and a critical success gives the item a characteristic of 2D6+12.

**Equipment with Skills**

Some equipment may possess skills, handled just like character skills. Any piece of equipment capable of independent action can have a skill. Some examples might be automated defense systems with the Artillery skill; educational programs using Teach; diagnostic systems using Repair; etc. In general, the more intelligent piece of equipment is, the more likely it is to have one or more skills.

Your gamemaster should set the values of these skills, based on the nature of the piece of equipment. If it has a characteristic related to the skill (for example, INT and Knowledge skills), its skill level may be a multiple of that characteristic (×1, ×3, ×5, etc.), depending on how efficient it is. **Other Equipment** provides examples of equipment with skills. If the item can speak or read, it should have a Language skill—usually the owner’s or creator’s native language.

To begin play with an item possessing skills, ‘pay’ for the item’s skill points out of your character’s personal skill point pool (from **Step Seven** of character creation) or the professional pool if the item is important to the performance of their profession.

Alternately, you can treat the item as if it had superpowers (see *Chapter 4: Powers*) and purchase the item as if it were a power. In this case, the following conditions apply:

-   The item has the character failing “Superpowered identity must be turned on in an obvious and preventable manner” tied to the item, usually a +1 power budget bonus.
-   Other power failings may apply, such as “Power has a limited number of uses per day” or “Power cannot improve through experience.”
-   Skills are purchased with the Super Skill power. It is assumed that all items have a 0% starting skill rating.
-   If no obvious attributes exist for the item, work with your gamemaster to determine its power supply, range, etc. Additional superpowers can be purchased to improve these attributes.

If you invest points in an item, you are going to want to have it available. Your gamemaster should do whatever they can to make sure that your item survives with your character, is readily repairable, or a replacement can be found easily, as appropriate to its value and the setting. Despite the fact that it is a distinct item, it is considered to be a part of your character, just as another character’s skill or power is, and removing it from your character’s possession should be done with extreme care, unless unavoidable.

Items with skills do not increase their skill rating through successful use of experience, unless the item has an INT and your gamemaster determines that it is capable of learning in some fashion.

**Equipment with Powers**

A piece of equipment can have properties above and beyond its normal capabilities, and with your gamemaster ’s permission, your character can purchase an item or piece of equipment with a power as described in *Chapter 4: Powers*. Additionally, your gamemaster may choose to represent a piece of equipment in terms of a power for ease determining its effectiveness against a powered character, and vice versa. This is usually only necessary in campaigns using powers, as normally the base attributes for an item are enough.

Following are guidelines for powered equipment, based on the power systems in *Chapter 4: Powers*.

**Magic Items:** A piece of equipment with one or more magic spells is called a *magic item*. This item appears magical to anyone able to detect such things, and allows the owner to cast a magic spell as if they were able to cast it themself. The magic item must have a skill rating with the spell. Most magic items have a power point capacity of their own, while rarer magic items use the owner’s power points as the reservoir.

-   A magic item is useless if it reaches 0 power points, though it can be recharged. To recharge a magic item, the user can move 1 power point from their body into the magic item each combat round.
-   A magic item can hold up to double its maximum power points. These extra power points vanish as they do with a player character.
-   Any spells the item casts follow all rules regarding the particular spell.
-   When the magic item is created, your gamemaster should determine whether if only the creator can use it, it must be defeated in a power point vs. power point resistance roll, or if anyone can use it.
-   The item has the normal hit points (based on SIZ) and attributes of an appropriate non-magical version.
-   The item’s hit points limit the number of power points it can store. As it takes damage, the maximum power points it can store are reduced. The item can be repaired normally, though if it is broken or destroyed, it is no longer magic and remains a normal item.
-   If a magic item is destroyed, any POW spent on it are lost.
-   A magic item may have one or more permanent magic spells bound into it that are always active, but creation of such an item costs five times the normal POW cost. Your gamemaster should determine whether a magic spell can be cast permanently on an item. If this item is created, it does not require power points and is simply always on at full strength.

**Mutated Items:** Items with mutations are fairly rare, as mutations are traditionally caused through genetic variance and few inanimate items are created through genetic manipulation.

-   An item can have one or more adverse mutations.
-   The item has the normal hit points (based on SIZ) and other attributes of a normal version, unless the mutation affects these characteristics.
-   Any characteristic rolls the item must make are based on the creator’s characteristics if it does not have its own characteristic.
-   A mutated item is considered to be alive and heals at the same rate as its creator.
-   A mutated item can be used by anyone making a successful Stamina roll.
-   Any CON and mutations invested into a mutated item are lost if it is destroyed.

**Equipment with Psychic Abilities:** Items with psychic abilities are incredibly rare, even more than items with mutations. These items are inevitably charged with psychic power, and should at least have POW. A character with any psychic ability automatically recognizes that an item has psychic abilities, and with an Idea roll, can utilize it. A character without psychic abilities can only determine if an item has psychic properties with a successful Idea roll, and must either defeat the item in a power point vs. power point resistance roll or a *Difficult* Luck roll. The creator of the item (or your gamemaster) decides who can use the item .

-   The item has the normal hit points (based on SIZ) and other attributes of a normal version of that item.
-   Psychic items are not alive, and can be damaged. They do not naturally heal, but can be repaired with an appropriate Craft or Repair skill roll. When they are destroyed they cease functioning. If a psychic item is broken into more than one piece, your gamemaster decides which piece, if any, retains the psychic ability.

**Equipment with Sorcery:** A piece of equipment with one or more sorcery spells is called an **artifact**. This artifact appears to have sorcerous properties to anyone able to detect such things, and allows your character to cast a sorcery spell as if they could cast it themselves, or the item has the sorcery spell cast upon itself permanently. Most artifacts have a power point reservoir of their own, while rarer artifacts draw upon the user’s own power points.

-   The creator of an artifact must sacrifice 1 point of permanent POW per sorcery spell invested in the artifact, and must know or have access to the spell(s) the artifact can use.
-   The artifact has a power point reservoir equal to its creator’s normal power points after it is created, or its SIZ, whichever is larger. Your gamemaster should set the POW and power point capacity if the artifact’s creator is unknown or is a nonplayer character.
-   The artifact either goes ‘unconscious’ when at 0 power points, or will be inert. To recharge an artifact, the user can move 1 power point from their body into the artifact each combat round.
-   An artifact can contain more than its normal power point capacity, as per a character, up to double its maximum power points. These extra power points vanish as they do with a character.
-   Any sorcery spells cast from the artifact follow all the normal rules regarding the particular spell.
-   When the artifact is created, your gamemaster should determine whether it will be personal (only its creator can use it), whether it must be defeated in a power point vs. power point resistance roll if it has power points, or if anyone can use it.
-   The artifact has the normal hit points (based on SIZ) and attributes of an appropriate non-sorcerous version.
-   The artifact’s hit points limit the number of power points that can be stored in it. As it takes damage, the maximum power points it stores are reduced. The artifact can be repaired as a normal item, though if it is broken or destroyed it can never be restored to artifact status and will remain a non-sorcerous item.
-   If an artifact is destroyed, any POW invested in it are lost.

Some artifacts have permanent sorcery spells bound into them that are always active. The POW cost to create these items is doubled.

**Equipment with Superpowers:** A piece of equipment with superpowers is called a gadget. Gadgets are the most flexible of all types of powered item, and can look like anything; mundane or crude to vastly advanced. A gadget’s appearance is entirely cosmetic and has nothing to do with its function: it can glow, shine, emit strange trails of energy, be carved with ancient runes, etc. A gadget does not seem unusually powerful unless the creator wants it to. Your gamemaster should set the power level of the gadget using the campaign power level guidelines presented in *Chapter 4: Powers*. Your gamemaster should assign any levels of superpowers to any gadget as desired, to suit the setting and the item’s requirements.

The following rules apply to gadgets:

-   The gadget’s hit points, SIZ, etc. are based off a normal item of equivalent size and mass. If no obvious equivalent exists, use the **Object SIZ Examples** table and the **Armor** table for guidelines. To change its size, use the Size Change power.
-   If the gadget needs a characteristic (such as POW for power points) should be built with the Super Characteristic power.
-   A gadget requiring a power supply greater than its POW should have the Extra Energy power.
-   To make the gadget more durable than a normal item, give it superpowers such as Absorption, Armor, Extra Hit Points, Force Field, etc.
-   Whenever applicable, the gadget should rely on its own characteristics. If a power requires a resistance roll, the gadget’s characteristic (if any) should be used. If the gadget doesn’t have the relevant characteristic, it automatically fails the resistance roll.
-   Whenever applicable, the gadget should rely on its user’s relevant skill.

**For example,** *if the gadget is a pistol, it must be fired with the Firearm skill. If it is a cosmically powered bracelet that allows the wielder to fire radioactive blasts, use the Projection skill.*

-   Your gamemaster should examine any superpowered items to be sure that they are not overly powered or otherwise unbalancing.
-   Superpowers invested in a gadget are permanent unless the item is destroyed.

**Equipment with Multiple Power Types:** Your gamemaster may wish to create a powered item drawing from multiple power types, such as a gadget that is also an artifact, using superpowers and sorcery. These should be only available at your gamemaster’s discretion. The following principles apply:

-   When possible, treat the item as being created as if it were a player with multiple power types.
-   An item must have all relevant characteristics or skills to use any powers it has.
-   All powers draw from the same pool of resources, whether power points or another source. Recharging the item must be handled in the appropriate manner for each power set.
-   If for some reason an item has two values to choose from to perform a particular action, use the higher of the two values where appropriate.

**Equipment with Requirements**

Some types of equipment may have requirements that must be met or exceeded to be used by your character. An example is weaponry, where most weapons have a minimum STR and DEX requirement. Other types of equipment are limited in other ways, such as the high fatigue point demand from wearing armor, and skill penalties associated with it. None of the basic equipment in this chapter have any requirements, though your gamemaster can easily introduce a restriction on the use of an item in two obvious ways:

-   **Characteristics:** As with weapons, a piece of equipment may be restricted by your characteristics. Usually this is STR or DEX, such as with weapons, or SIZ for armor, but it could easily be POW for a magical item, INT for a computer, or some other characteristic-based minimum (or maximum).
-   **Skills:** Your character may find that a specific piece of equipment is incomprehensible or useless unless their skill is at a certain level. Usually the skill represents an understanding of the piece of equipment and the principles it operates under.

**For example,** *a diagnostic computer may require a skill of at least 50% in Technical (Computer Use) to operate.*

It is recommended that restrictions be used sparingly, and only if there is a legitimate reason for them to exist. Before assigning an outright restriction on an item’s use, your gamemaster should determine if there is some means of enforcing the restriction, and if there are any penalties for using the item if your character does not meet the requirements. Some possible penalties include additional fatigue points to use, making any associated skill rolls *Difficult*, or requiring an associated characteristic roll to avoid mishaps.

**Charges or Limited-Use Equipment**

Many types of equipment run on power batteries or can be used only a limited number of times. In most cases batteries can be replaced fairly easily, ammunition replenished, and other required resources recharged or refilled. Most firearms have ‘charges’ in the form of ammunition, but if maintained well, a sword or suit of armor can be used until it is broken. Whenever appropriate, the resource required to refill or recharge a piece of equipment is either essentially free (such as electricity or solar power), or is two or three Wealth levels lower than the equipment’s cost. If a charging device is required, it is a part of the piece of equipment’s normal value.

Usually it’s easiest to assume that given adequate time and planning, your character has adequate ammunition, batteries, refills, cartridges, power cells, etc. for all their gear, unless the setting or circumstances make this is difficult or impossible. In these cases, your gamemaster may require a Research, Status, or Luck roll to come across the relevant type of charge. In some settings (postapocalyptic, for example) ammunition, gasoline, and/or power cells are extremely difficult to come by and are usually more valuable than the equipment they’re used in.

**Repairing Equipment**

If an item has been damaged in the course of play, your gamemaster should determine if it can be repaired, based on common sense and the nature of the damage dealt. In most cases, a relevant Repair or Craft skill roll may be used like the First Aid skill, restoring damaged hit points or SIZ points as per the guidelines for that skill. In the case of complex equipment, your gamemaster may require a Knowledge roll to find a resource for replacement components, or even require an *Easy* skill roll based on the repair skill being used to locate the necessary parts. If these components are expensive, your gamemaster may require a Status roll to legitimately obtain required replacements.

**Weapons**

Throughout history, many different types of weapons have developed as a result of changes in technology, availability of materials, and changing battlefield conditions. This section presents a representative sampling of this wide variety. If your gamemaster wishes to create more accurate weapon lists for a setting, it is easy enough to extrapolate the relevant attributes from these examples.

Weapons described in this section are categorized broadly by chronological settings for ease of use. In most cases, weapons from an earlier period are available to people from later periods, so your gamemaster may simply choose where weapon availability stops and allow your character access to weapons prior to that point.

Each weapon has the following attributes:

-   **Name:** The common name for the weapon.
-   **Skill:** The skill used to wield it.
-   **Base:** The base chance to use the weapon.
-   **Dmg:** The damage done by the weapon. A ‘+dm’ indicates damage modifier, and +½dm is half the damage modifier (round up).
-   **Attk:** How many attacks-per-round does the weapon allow?
-   **Special:** What type of special success does the weapon do?
-   **Rng:** The basic range of the weapon. At its basic range, the skill is unmodified. At medium range (double the basic range), the skill use becomes *Difficult*, and at long range (four times basic range) it becomes 1/5 the normal skill rating (equal to the chance of a special).
-   **Hands:** How many hands does the weapon require? 1H=one-handed, 2H=two-handed.
-   **HP:** The weapon’s hit points.
-   **Parry:** Can the weapon be used to parry?
-   **Mal:** The weapon malfunctions if this is rolled (see **Malfunctions**). If the weapon is not a firearm, the malfunction is some other mishap preventing immediate reuse of the weapon.
-   **Ammo:** How many times can the weapon be used without being reloaded or recharged?
-   **Value:** What is the weapon’s average cost in an appropriate setting?
-   **STR/DEX:** What are the minimum STR and DEX required to use the weapon?
-   **SIZ/ENC:** The weapon’s SIZ and Encumbrance value.
-   **RF:** (Optional) Rate of fire (see **Volley Fire**). 1/\#CR means that the weapon is so clumsy it can only be used once a number (\#) of combat rounds. X/CR means that it can be used X times per combat round when using volley fire.

**Weapon Descriptions**

Following are all weapons from the melee and missile weapon tables, organized alphabetically.

**Arbalest:** A very heavy crossbow, difficult to cock and load, often used with a device called a cranequin. It does tremendous damage when it hits.

**Axe, Battle:** A one-handed axe used primarily in combat. It may have one blade or two.

**Axe, Great:** A large, two-handed axe that either may be single or double-bladed.

**Axe, Hand:** A small one-handed axe that can be thrown or used by hand. It may have one blade or two. Tool versions are used to chop wood.

**Axe, Vibro-:** A long-handled axe with one or two blades mounted into a generator in the haft. The blades vibrate at an extraordinary rate, capable of shearing through most substances.

**Axe, Wood:** A long-handled axe that can be used one- or two-handed, with one blade or two. It is not built for combat, but is sometimes utilized so.

**Blackjack:** A small sewn leather sack full of something heavy like lead shot, used to knock someone out when attacking from behind. Also called a sap or cosh.

**Blowgun:** A hollow, straight pipe up to a meter in length used to project small darts by blowing at one end of the pipe. These darts do little damage but are often poisoned.

**Bola:** Two or three hard balls attached together by a length of cord or chain. This weapon is thrown to entangle and bring down a foe, with damage a secondary concern.

**Boomerang:** A flat, angle-shaped stick made to be thrown in a curving path. It was traditionally used by aboriginal hunters to stun or kill small animals.

**Bow, Composite:** A bow made of materials that make it both rigid and flexible. Historical versions are made of wood and horn, and modern varieties are made with graphite and ultralight metals.

**Bow, Long:** A bow made either from one piece of wood (such as the famous English longbow), or in the same fashion as a composite bow.

**Bow, Self:** A basic bow made of one or two pieces of wood shaped and cured to prevent breaking.

**Brass Knuckles:** Metal weights worn on the fist to add weight and a hard edge to punches.

**Cestus:** Metal boxing gloves, with a weight nestled within the glove for more impact. An ancient precursor to brass knuckles.

**Chainsaw:** A woodcutting tool consisting of an edged chain driven to revolve at high speed around a flat metal blade.

**Claw:** A bladed weapon shaped like animal claws, usually held in hand with the blades sticking through the fingers, or worn on the back of the hand.

**Club, Heavy:** A long heavy piece of wood or metal. This also describes a crowbar.

**Club, Light:** A lighter version of the heavy club. This can be a baseball bat, tire iron, lamp, chair leg, or truncheon.

**Crossbow, Heavy:** This crossbow must be cocked by a lever apparatus. Easier to load than an arbalest, but less powerful.

**Crossbow, Light:** This crossbow can be cocked by hand, mostly used for hunting or stealth, rather than on the battlefield.

**Crossbow, Medium:** This crossbow is cocked by hooking one end with a foot and using a claw mechanism to draw the string back.

**Crossbow, Repeating:** A complex crossbow with a magazine of bolts that may be fired as fast as a bow may be fired. Once the magazine is exhausted, the repeating crossbow takes at least six combat rounds to reload.

**Dagger:** A short-bladed weapon, usually less than 40 centimeters long, sharp on one or both edges.

**Dart:** Short, weighted points suitable for throwing, either feathered or plain. They are often used to deliver poison.

**Detonator, Antimatter:** Perhaps the most powerful personal-scale explosive, this can wipe out everything in a tight radius. These are used with timers, coded remote detonators, and magnetic bases.

**Detonator, Electromagnetic Pulse:** Instead of exploding, this device emits an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) designed to disrupt electrical devices and electronic circuitry. Unlike the EMP generated as a secondary effect of a nuclear weapon, this is a non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse, disruptive solely to electronic devices.

**Detonator, Fusion:** An extremely powerful sub-nuclear bomb, capable of immense destructive force. Comes with a timer, coded remote detonator, and magnetic base.

**Detonator, Plasma:** An explosive capable of generating and spraying a charge of plasma, the superheated intermediate state between gas and liquid. These come with timers, coded remote detonators, and magnetic bases.

**Detonator, Sonic:** A device that emits a destructive and concussive sonic pulse that can shatter glass and other brittle matter, as well as stunning any living targets caught in its range of effect.

**Explosive, Blasting Cap:** A small explosive used to set off a larger explosive. Older ones used fuses, while newer ones use electricity or more sophisticated methods to set off the explosive.

**Explosive, Dynamite:** Sticks of chemical explosive soaked into a solid like sawdust, wrapped in thick paper and ignited by sparks from a fuse or a smaller explosion from a blasting cap. This is highly dangerous, as it tends to ‘sweat’ nitroglycerine and becomes unstable when left alone for too long.

**Explosive, Improvised:** Usually a pipe bomb, this describes any number of small homemade chemical explosives.

**Explosive, Plastic:** A modern chemical explosive mixed with a substance like petroleum or wax into a malleable, putty-like plastic form, able to be molded and shaped as required. Used with a timer and often set off with an electrical charge. Also called plastique.

**Fist:** An unarmed attack using the Brawl skill.

**Flail:** A flail head mounted on the end of a short chain connected to a haft about a meter long, or longer.

**Flail, Morningstar:** A medieval weapon with a handle, a length of chain, and a spiked ball at the end. Some do not have spikes and are simply weighted or studded balls at the end of the chains.

**Flamethrower:** A tank full of a highly combustible chemical attached to a projector/igniter that sprays jets of flaming liquid. Flamethrowers can also be used to soak an area or item in this flammable chemical without setting it afire. Incredibly dangerous due to the short range, limited period of use, and potential for setting oneself on fire. Flamethrowers may blow up when the tank is struck, causing double rolled damage to everyone within five meters of the user. Make a Luck roll to avoid this.

**Garrote:** A short cord used for strangling, whether a thin metal cable, ceremonial rope, to improvised use of a scarf or belt.

**Gauntlet, Armored:** A metal gauntlet worn with armor or without, adding damage to successful strikes with the Brawl skill.

**Grapple:** An unarmed attack using the Grapple skill.

**Grenade, Antimatter:** A small but extraordinarily powerful explosive device triggered and thrown at foes, items, or structures. Though containing infinitely tiny amounts of antimatter, these grenades are usually fired from launchers, as they are so destructive that it is difficult to throw one outside of its own blast radius.

**Grenade, Concussion:** A small explosive device triggered and thrown at foes or into enclosed areas, where it can stun those caught in the blast radius. Sometimes called a stun grenade.

**Grenade, Disintegrator:** A grenade capable of disintegrating all of the matter (or shattering molecular bonds) in the blast radius. Highly dangerous, disintegrator grenades are generally used only as weapons of last resort.

**Grenade, Electromagnetic Pulse:** A grenade with electromagnetic pulse capability. When thrown at a metallic target, the magnetic surface add +20% to your chance of hitting successfully.

**Grenade, Explosive:** A small explosive triggered and thrown, resulting in an explosion of concussive force and shrapnel.

**Grenade, Flare:** A stick of flammable chemicals triggered and thrown to light darkened areas or provide light-marking for air targeting.

**Grenade, Fusion:** An extremely powerful sub-nuclear device, capable of immense destructive force. Fusion grenades are only fired from launchers or thrown in situations where the user has adequate time to get out of the blast range.

**Grenade, Gas:** A small chemical explosive device triggered and thrown or rolled, emitting a toxic or otherwise harmful gas. These can be filled with a variety of gases (mustard, tear, knockout, etc.).

**Grenade, Molotov Cocktail:** An improvised explosive made from a bottle and fuse, lit and hurled, usually to set them or it afire.

**Grenade, Phosphorous:** A small chemical explosive device triggered and thrown. It emits a highly flammable chemical fire that can melt equipment and set objects aflame, or simply light a darkened area for ground personnel or targeting from airships.

**Grenade, Plasma:** A grenade using plasma technology. Extremely explosive and capable of causing immense destruction and fire.

**Grenade, Shock:** A grenade that releases an electrical charge, equipped with magnetic surfaces to stick to any metallic surface it is thrown onto. When thrown at a metallic target, the magnetic surface adds +20% to your chance of hitting successfully.

**Grenade, Shrapnel:** A small explosive device triggered and thrown at enemies, set to emit deadly, flesh-piercing shrapnel.

**Grenade, Smoke:** A gas grenade (see above) that emits harmless but shrouding smoke.

**Grenade, Sonic:** A grenade using sonic pulse technology that emits a high-frequency sonic burst to disable or distract targets.

**Grenade, Stun:** A grenade emitting a mildly concussive blast designed specifically to stun or temporarily disable targets.

**Gun, Machine:** A rapidly-repeating firearm with trigger settings for single-shot, short bursts, and full autofire.

**Gun, Mini-:** A Gatling-style heavy machine gun, often mounted on helicopters or vehicles. The STR requirement is if wielded in hand.

**Gun, Submachine:** A small machine gun, designed for one-handed use.

**Halberd:** An broad axe head on a two-meter shaft. Commonly used by medieval city guardsmen or against mounted foes.

**Hammer:** A common household tool used for carpentry or a small, one-handed military weapon with a striking head.

**Hammer, Great:** A massive hammer used with two hands.

**Hammer, Sledge:** A heavy tool used by construction workers and demolition crews, used two-handed.

**Hammer, War:** Designed like a hammer, this weapon often has a spike rather than a flat head, ideal for punching through armor.

**Head Butt:** An unarmed attack using the Brawl skill.

**Javelin:** A short spear used one- or two-handed, or for throwing.

**Katana:** A single-edged, slightly curved long sword, used one- or two-handed, fetishized for its workmanship and sharpness.

**Kick:** An unarmed attack using the Brawl skill.

**Knife:** A tool suitable for eating, cutting, defense, or impromptu assassination. Like a dagger, though lighter and less durable.

**Knife, Butcher:** A large heavy kitchen knife, suitable for hacking through large chunks of meat in a single blow.

**Knife, Pocket:** A small folding knife, often with multiple blades.

**Knife, Switchblade:** A retractable pocketknife.

**Knife, Throwing:** A knife balanced for throwing, usually hiltless.

**Knife, Vibro:** A high-tech knife blade set into a mechanical hilt, vibrated at an extremely high speed. Extraordinarily sharp, the vibration adds additional shearing force to even slight cuts.

**Lance:** A long spear used one-handed on horseback. While mounted, the attacker uses the mount’s damage modifier in place of their own. Lances can also be used on foot as a two-handed spear, with its normal damage modifier.

**Lance, Stun:** A staff-shaped weapon with a charged electric prod at one end. Some stun lances have goads at both ends.

**Lasso:** The traditional lariat used for cattle-wrangling. It does no damage but does immobilize the target using the entangling rules.

**Launcher, Grenade:** A hand-held or stationary launcher that fires grenades great distances. It can be a small platform, a hand-held firearm-shaped launcher, or attached to another firearm.

**Launcher, LAW Rocket:** A lightweight, disposable one-shot rocket launcher, also known as the light anti-tank weapon (LAW).

**Launcher, Rocket:** A smallish tube and platform assembled on the battlefield, used to fire rockets more accurately.

**Mace, Heavy:** A haft with a heavy weight for the head, spiked, flanged, studded, or plain.

**Mace, Light:** A haft with a light weight used to bash and crush.

**Maul, War:** A long-handled two-headed hammer used two-handed.

**Mine, Antipersonnel:** A land mine built primarily to wound rather than kill (maximizing difficulty to the enemy).

**Mine, Antitank:** A mine made to damage tank treads or enemy vehicles.

**Naginata:** A long spear with a sword-like head, used for cutting and thrusting attacks.

**Net:** A loose mesh of woven cord used to catch animals or larger targets. While smaller nets are used for small game, the net described here is large enough for use against humans.

**Pike:** A long spear (3–5 meters) used in formation combat. Also common to town guards and castle defense. Pikes are the best defense (short of a fusillade of gunfire) against a cavalry charge.

**Pistol, Blaster:** A pistol firing a short burst of energy, usually plasma, burning the target and causing concussion. Blaster pistols are usually powered by clips containing exotic chemical fuels.

**Pistol, Derringer:** A tiny hand-held pistol, usually palm-sized. Easily concealed, with a low ammo capacity. Some are one- or two-shot, others have small clips. Sometimes called a ‘holdout’ pistol.

**Pistol, Disintegrator:** A pistol firing an immensely destructive energy blast that rapidly disintegrates an entire target, or large portions of that target. Disintegrator pistols can be powered with energy cells or fuel clips.

**Pistol, Electromagnetic Pulse:** A pistol that fires a directed electromagnetic pulse stream at a target such as a computer or robot, disabling its circuitry.

**Pistol, Flechette:** A small, light pistol powered by either magnetic charges or gas, firing many tiny, sharp needle-like blades at a target. These generally have short range and are not very effective against armored targets, but are devastating to unarmored foes at short range. They use both clips of flechette ammunition and a gas cylinder or energy clip. Sometimes called a ‘needle gun’.

**Pistol, Flintlock:** A pistol using flint and steel to ignite a hand-packed wad of gunpowder. Similar to a wheel-lock pistol.

**Pistol, Heavy:** A heavy-framed pistol possessing superior stopping power. Slower than smaller, lighter pistols. The .357 magnum is an excellent example.

**Pistol, Laser:** A pistol firing a high-intensity beam of light capable of searing through most substances, even melting metal. Usually powered by an energy cell containing a limited number of charges.

**Pistol, Light:** A light-framed pistol trading stopping power for accuracy and rate of fire. The .22 caliber is an excellent example.

**Pistol, Medium:** A medium-framed pistol, reliable and with moderate firepower and rate of fire. The 9mm pistol is an excellent example.

**Pistol, Plasma:** A pistol firing a focused stream of superheated plasma, usually powered by an energy or plasma cell.

**Pistol, Shock:** A pistol that emits a high-voltage electrical burst.

**Pistol, Sonic:** A pistol emitting a focused cone of sonic waves, damaging to living tissue and inert matter alike.

**Pistol, Stun:** A pistol emitting a burst of energy the same frequency as the human nervous system, short-ranged and designed for pacification. Useless against objects and beings larger than humanoid, though they can be adjusted for other targets. Sometimes called a ‘stunner’.

**Rapier:** A slender-bladed one-handed sword, primarily used for thrusting. Though each is unique, this also describes the epee and foil, two other fencing swords.

**Revolver, Heavy:** A heavy pistol of large caliber, like a .44 magnum or the Colt .45.

**Revolver, Light:** A light pistol, usually in the .22 to .32 caliber range.

**Rifle, Assault:** A heavy, rugged rifle with a large ammo capacity, fired like a machine gun (one-shot, short bursts, or autofire).

**Rifle, Blaster:** A rifle firing short energy bursts, usually plasma that burns plus concussive impact. Blaster rifles are usually powered by clips containing exotic chemical fuels.

**Rifle, Bolt-action:** A rifle with a sliding bolt. Some use clips, while others store bullets in magazines the length of the rifle’s barrel.

**Rifle, Disintegrator:** A rifle that emits an immensely destructive energy blast that rapidly disintegrates an entire target or large portions of that target. Disintegrator rifles can be powered with energy cells or fuel clips.

**Rifle, Elephant:** A huge caliber rifle designed to bring down the largest of game animals. Sometimes double-barreled, these often are breech-loaded, one thick bullet at a time.

**Rifle, Laser:** A rifle firing a high-intensity beam of light capable of searing through most substances, even melting metal. Laser rifles are usually powered by energy cells with limited charges.

**Rifle, Lever-action:** A rifle with an external lever used to cycle ammo. Popular with hunters, though impractical for military use.

**Rifle, Musket:** An early rifle loaded down the barrel and sometimes filled with either shrapnel shot or large ball-like bullets. Slow and unreliable, ignited with a flint or wheel-lock.

**Rifle, Electromagnetic Pulse:** A rifle version of the electromagnetic pulse pistol, emitting a focused blast of electromagnetic energy at an electric-using or electronic target.

**Rifle, Plasma:** A rifle version of a plasma pistol, capable of firing a focused burst of superheated plasma at the target.

**Weapon Classes**

The descriptions for the Heavy Weapon, Melee Weapon, and Missile Weapon skills in *Chapter 3: Skills* refer to weapon specialties and **weapon classes**. A weapon class is a rough group the weapon belongs to, while the **specialty** is your character’s skill using weapons in that class. Weapons fall into classes, with skills into specialties.

**Using Weapons of the Same Class**

Use your skill specialty with all weapons of that particular class. This generalization means your character can use most types of similar weapons without hindrance.

**For example,** *if your character has the skill Melee Weapon (Sword), this applies to long swords, broadswords, short swords, etc., just as Firearm (Revolver) applies to light, medium, and heavy revolvers.*

**Using Weapons of Different Classes**

If you have skill in one weapon class, your gamemaster may allow your character to use a similar weapon in a different class at the same skill rating as if the skill were Difficult.

**For example,** *if your character has Missile Weapon (Bow) 60%, your gamemaster may allow the use of crossbows (a different weapon class) as a Difficult Missile Weapon (Bow) skill, a temporary skill rating of 30%.*

If using a weapon with a temporary skill rating is successful and any experience is gained, the experience roll is made from the base chance rather than the temporary skill rating. Any experience is added to the weapon or weapon skill’s base chance rather than the temporary skill rating. When your character exceeds the temporary skill rating, the actual skill rating becomes the default.

Notes:

1.  Stuns target (see **Stunning**).
2.  Many modern firearms have burst fire capabilities (see **Autofire**).
3.  If a target is hit by a flamethrower, it is on fire and takes 1D6+2 points per round in additional damage until the fire is extinguished (see **Fire and Heat**).
4.  Sniper rifles are usually equipped with a bipod, doubling the chance; without a bipod (or similar stabilizer), reduce the base chance to 10%.
5.  Sniper rifles are usually equipped with telescopic scopes that double their effective range; if without a scope, the range is 125 meters.
6.  Shotguns do damage by range; the first increment is the first damage dice, the second is the second, etc.
7.  Shotguns do damage by range; the first increment is the first damage dice, the second is the second, etc. Sawed-off shotguns are not effective beyond 20 yards.
8.  Chemical spray is a low-POT contact poison (see **Poisons**). An example type of chemical spray might have 2D6+12 POT, instant effect, and cause blindness if the target fails a resistance roll vs. CON. It is *Difficult* to shoot into a target’s eyes, but Easy at point-blank range, making the chance unaffected.

**Spot Rules for Firearms**

*Chapter 7: Spot Rules* covers many conditions regarding firearms, such as automatic fire, range, etc. Following are additional rules of use. Your gamemaster may choose to allow these to cover additional types of ranged weapons, such as energy or laser weapons.

**Armor and Firearms**

Armor types from earlier periods are relatively ineffective against weapons from later periods; a knight’s armor provides scant protection from firearms. Any primitive, ancient, or medieval armors only have half their value against firearms (rounded up). The same is true of modern armor versus advanced weaponry. Advanced armor protects at full value against all weapons. To summarize:

-   **Primitive or Ancient** armor only offers ½ protection against high-velocity or energy weapons (round up).
-   **Modern** armor offers ½ protection against energy weaponry (round up).
-   **Advanced** armor offers full protection against all forms of attack. Your gamemaster may rule that advanced armor only protects at ½ its armor value versus energy weapons (round up).

If armor value is determined randomly, roll for the armor’s protection, apply any modifiers, then divide in half, rounding up. Some armors already state the difference in coverage between hand weapons and high-velocity weapons—these do not need to be reduced twice. Some types of monsters may also be resistant to firearms, noted in their descriptions in Chapter 11: Creatures.

**Loaded Revolvers**

For early model revolvers, chamber directly under a revolver’s hammer is often left empty against an accidental discharge. If this practice is followed, lower the ammunition capacity by 1. To emphasize the danger of carrying a fully-loaded revolver, your gamemaster may require your character to make a successful Luck roll to avoid an accidental discharge if your character falls or is jostled roughly enough to potentially trigger the weapon. If the Luck roll succeeds, the revolver does not go off. If it fails, the revolver goes off, and your character and everyone around your character must make a Luck roll to avoid being hit by the stray bullet. Your gamemaster should determine who the friendly fire strikes. If the initial Luck roll is a fumble, the bullet strikes your character and does normal damage.

**Malfunctions**

If your character’s attack roll is equal to or higher than the weapon’s malfunction number, the weapon malfunctions and will not fire until it has been dealt with.

-   If the weapon is a revolver, bolt-action rifle, or a double-barreled shotgun, the problem is only a dud round.
-   If the weapon is an automatic, semi-automatic, pump-action, or lever-action, the malfunction is a jam.

A dud round can be cycled past or ejected in one combat round. Fixing a jam takes 1D6 combat rounds and requires a successful skill roll of either the firearm skill or Repair, whichever is higher. Your character can keep trying until they succeed, with each attempt taking an additional 1D6 combat rounds. A roll of 96–00 on this attempt results in the firearm becoming irrevocably damaged and beyond casual repair.

A fumble may also overlap with a malfunction. If the results of both are contradictory, your gamemaster should address them in the most practical order, applying both results whenever possible. Weapons other than firearms can malfunction, and can be cleared with in the same way. For energy weapons, the ‘dud round’ is likely an incomplete or faulty charge.

**Reloading Firearms**

It takes one combat round to load two shells or bullets into any handgun, rifle, or shotgun, and one combat round to exchange a clip, energy cell, or battery pack. Changing a machine gun belt takes two combat rounds. If time is of the essence, it is possible to put one round into a firearm and get a single shot off at ½ your character’s normal DEX rank (round up).

**Unaimed Shots**

The attacks-per-round entry (**Attk**) for ranged weapons assumes that your character is trying to hit a target directly, and is making an attempt to aim. If you wish for your character to spray an area with shots, such as if providing covering fire, and accuracy is not a concern, you can double the weapon’s attacks-per-round, but the chance to hit is reduced to 1/5 your character’s skill (equal to the chance of a special success, though the result is a normal success). If there is more than one target your gamemaster should determine randomly who is struck. At your gamemaster’s discretion, if your character is prepared, equipped with a laser sight or equivalent targeting device, and has a weapon skill of over 60%, the chance to hit is not modified.

Notes:

1.  Roll damage and pit it vs. the target’s CON in a resistance roll. If target loses, they are stunned for 1D3+1 rounds (see **Stunning**).
2.  Reduce the target’s armor value by ½ (round up) versus this weapon.
3.  If you fumble an attack with a monofilament sword, make a *Difficult* Agility roll to avoid hitting yourself. If you fail, your attack hits you in addition to the roll on the melee weapon fumble table. Damage ignores ½ armor value (round up).
4.  Many missile weapons have burst fire capabilities (see **Autofire**).
5.  If the target is a robot, machine, or uses electromagnetic energy, roll damage and make a resistance roll vs. the target’s CON. If successful, the device is stunned for 1D3+1 rounds (see **Stunning**). If the damage is higher than the target’s hit points, it is knocked ‘unconscious’. Damage from EMP weapons is temporary, and lost hit points can be restored with a Repair roll.
6.  Against a foe with hardened armor (metal, plastic, or plates), a flechette pistol does only ½ damage (round up).
7.  A flechette pistol fires clusters of flechettes, either one ‘shot’ or a long burst that empties the magazine. Each shot is a single attack, doing 2D4 damage.
8.  A sonic rifle damages living targets each combat round it successfully strikes them. Against an unliving target, the damage per round is rolled in a resistance roll vs. the target’s CON, armor value, or hit points (gamemaster choice). If the target fails, it shatters or is damaged and non-functional.
9.  Roll damage and pit it vs. the target’s CON in a resistance roll. If the target succeeds, they take minimum damage (2) instead of the rolled damage. If target loses, they are stunned for 1D3+1 rounds (see **Stunning**).

**Armor**

At a basic level, armor is hardened clothing. Depending on the setting, armor is made of leather, metal, plastic, or some combination of these materials, and it is worn to have something protective between oneself and a source of harm. Armor is heavier than normal clothing and frequently uncomfortable and awkward to wear. If your character is a warrior, they are likely to be more comfortable in armor than the average person, though wearing armor is rarely more comfortable than not wearing armor.

Armor described in this section is categorized loosely chronologically, for reference. In most cases, armor from an earlier period is available to people from later periods, so your gamemaster may choose where armor availability stops and allow your character access to prior types.

Each type of armor has the following attributes:

-   Name: The common name.
-   AV: The armor value, the amount the armor protects.
-   Random AV: (Optional) This is the armor value if random armor values are being used.
-   Burden: The awkwardness or relative encumbrance of the armor. Your gamemaster may use this value with the optional fatigue system.
-   ENC: This value is for a character of average SIZ (11–15). For SIZ 6–10, multiply the ENC value by .8; for SIZ 16–20 multiply the value by 1.2; for SIZ 21–25 multiply it by 1.4, etc. (round up)
-   Skill Modifier: A modifier to certain skills or skill categories while the armor is worn, also applied to any appropriate skill.
-   Fits SIZ: The variance the armor’s default SIZ can accommodate from its default SIZ, expressed as a positive or negative value.
-   Time: How many combat rounds it takes to put the armor on.
-   Locations: (Optional) If the hit locations are used, the hit locations covered by the armor.
-   Value: The armor’s cost in an average setting.

Unlike weapons and shields, armor generally does not suffer damage, unless by environmental factors. Armor is designed for defense; it can take a lot of pounding. Armor value is never reduced through damage in combat—instead, any change to armor value must come from some exceptional event.

**Armor Descriptions**

This section describes all types of armor, alphabetically.

**Adaptive Mesh:** This high-tech cloth hardens and reacts to impacts, but remains pliant and comfortable the rest of the time. Usually worn as a bodysuit, it can be layered under other armor.

**Assault Armor, Light:** Light armor used by soldiers to resist hand-to-hand weapons, solid projectiles, as well as against energy weapons. Made of ceramics, alloys, or high-impact plastics.

**Assault Armor, Standard:** Heavy armor, made for battles in hazardous environments. Made of ceramics, alloys, or resistant plastics, assault armor provides head-to-toe protection and is favored by the military.

**Assault Armor (Heavy), Powered:** Similar to standard assault armor but more massive and with thicker armored plating. Internal servo-motors boost the wearer’s strength. Combatants in powered heavy assault armor often wield massive weapons. The frame accepts modular enhancements (such as a jetpack) and is sealed against chemical weapons and the vacuum of space.

**Assault Armor (Light), Powered:** Similar to powered assault armor above, but lighter and lacking extras such as sealed systems.

**Ballistic Cloth:** Made of aramid fiber, ballistic cloth armor provides moderate protection against bullets, though not as much as a bulletproof vest. Normally worn under street clothing or fashioned to resemble normal clothing.

**Bulletproof Vest, Early:** An older variant of the bulletproof vest, heavy and cumbersome, with thickened metal plates in a segmented canvas vest.

**Bulletproof Vest, Modern:** An evolution of the bulletproof vest, using high-impact metal alloys and plastics for a lighter, thinner form of protection.

**Chain:** This armor consists of a mesh made of woven metal links. It is extremely flexible, but quite heavy.

**Clothing, Heavy:** The equivalent of wearing an heavy cloak, a winter jacket, tight leather clothing, or multiple layers of clothing.

**Energy Armor:** This armor consists of an internal power pack worn on the belt or slung over the back, between the shoulders, and possibly connected to emitters distributed across the body. When activated, it covers the character with a sheath of protective energy.

**Flak Jacket:** This is a full jacket similar to an early bulletproof vest, though less armored, useful for pilots and ground troops alike.

**Helmet, Heavy or Light:** Almost all these armor types have helmets. Full suits of armor usually include helmets. If a helmet is not worn, reduce the armor value by –1 for a light helmet, and –2 for a heavy helmet. If using random armor values, modify the range by –1 or –2, as appropriate. If hit locations are used, a helmet has the same protective value as an arm or leg of the relevant armor material.

**Hide:** A tanned or untanned animal coat, worn as a cloak or garment, fur intact.

**Lamellar (Studded, Splinted):** This armor consists of thin metal strips (splints) usually held onto leather backing with rivets (studs).

**Leather, Soft:** An equivalent to a leather jacket or vest, soft leather is often worn under other armor as additional padding and protection.

**Leather, Hard:** This is equal to a half-centimeter of cured leather, about as thick as the sole of a dress shoe. It may have leather studs or embossed work.

**Leather, Cuirbouilli:** Thick and semirigid leather that has been cured and boiled in oil and wax, then molded to the form of the wearer. It is often ornamented and stained colorfully.

**Padded/Quilted:** This armor consists of sandwiched layers of stiffened thick cloth, sewn together as if a pad or quilt. Cheap and easy to make, it does not offer very much protection, though it can be worn beneath metal armor such as halfplate and chain.

**Padded/Quilted, Heavy:** Similar to padded or quilted armor, but heavier and thicker.

**Plate, Half:** This armor consists of a partial suit of plate (see below) that does not cover the entire body. Usually, it is a breastplate, helmet, and some smaller pieces, with chain covering the rest.

**Plate, Full:** This armor consists of solid plates of metal, molded to the body and held together with covered leather straps. Historically, this was superior to any other type of body armor, but the all-metal construction makes it the heaviest and least comfortable.

**Ring:** This is soft leather or other backing with metal rings sewn onto it in a close or overlapping pattern.

**Riot Gear:** A heavy bulletproof jacket and toughened clothing coverall, with plates in strategic body parts and a helmet.

**Scale:** Scale armor (sometimes called scale mail) consists of overlapping metal scales of various shapes and sizes fastened onto a backing.

**Splint:** See the description for lamellar.

**Studded:** See the description for lamellar.

Notes:

1.  Includes helmet.
2.  Energy armor can be set by its wearer for any value between 1 and 20 points of AV. Each combat round the armor expends charges (power points) equal to its AV. Standard armor power supplies hold 200 charges; each damage point absorbed costs 1 additional charge. Energy armor does not allow random armor value; use the set AV. It takes 5 DEX ranks to adjust the AV.
3.  Can not be worn with other armor.
4.  Light powered assault armor modifies STR by +3 and DEX by –3 (adjust relevant values when worn). Armor includes helmet.
5.  Heavy powered assault armor modifies STR by +6 and DEX by –6 (adjust relevant values when worn). Armor includes helmet.

**Special rules for Armor**

The following rules apply to various situations involving armor.

**Armor Encumbrance**

Armor encumbrance (ENC) depends on the SIZ of the character wearing it. The SIZ of the character determines the SIZ of the armor in most cases. Each increment of +5 SIZ adds to the ENC of the armor, being heavier, hotter, clumsier to wear, etc. SIZ es of 11–15 are standard. Each 5–point increment of SIZ below that range is 1/5 less encumbering. The following ENC values can be used for hit locations.

| **Hit Location** | **Fraction of Total ENC** |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Head             | 1/10                      |
| Arm              | 1/10 each                 |
| Chest            | 1/5                       |
| Abdomen          | 1/10                      |
| Leg              | 1/5 each                  |

**Layering Armor**

It’s possible to wear soft armor under or over hard armor to provide added protection. Only soft, pliable armor like heavy cloth, padded, or soft leather can easily be worn layered with other forms of armor, and they add their usual armor value as well as their ENC value. When trying to overlap anything other than soft armor with hard, total the armor value but triple the ENC of the lesser armor.

**Putting Armor On**

Some types of armor are more complicated to put on than everyday clothing. There are straps and buckles to fasten, multiple pieces to don, and there may be several layers. It takes one combat round for every point of protection a suit of armor offers to put it on, assuming that your character is ready, the armor has been laid out, and there are no hazardous or distracting environmental elements. Your gamemaster may increase the time it takes if previously distracted or asleep, or in challenging circumstances (running, heavily injured, darkness, underwater, mounted, etc.). This may require an Agility or Idea roll if sufficiently distracted or inconvenienced.

**Taking Armor Off**

Taking off armor is much easier than putting it on, since your character doesn’t have to make sure each piece is properly arranged before putting on the next one. Your character can remove 3 armor value per combat round (round up) if moving rapidly. A successful Agility roll increases this to 4 armor value per combat round. Use the maximum value of the armor if using random armor values.

**Armor by Hit Location (Option)**

If using the hit location system, you may wish for more granularity in how your character is armored. Each type of armor in the armor tables lists the hit locations it covers. Your character can vary the type of armor they are wearing on each hit location, using any type that covers that location. Each type of armor worn may have a different armor value.

-   To determine the armor value of each piece, use the armor value from the armor charts.
-   The burden is that of the pieces worn on the chest, abdomen, or legs, using the heaviest if these differ.
-   Use the skill modifier of the heaviest piece worn on the chest, abdomen, or legs. Helmets have the same modifiers.
-   It takes one combat round per 5 points of armor value (round up) to put on individual pieces of armor.

Your gamemaster may rule that some types of armor cannot be used piecemeal, such as most modern or advanced armor types. Armor by hit locations is not recommended with the random armor value system.

Use the rules for **Armor by Hit Location** and **Layering Armor** when using armor by hit location.

**Helmets**

The armor tables describe helmets as a bonus to armor value. When using armor by hit location, helmets have armor values of their own. Use the following values for helmets:

| **Type**                             | **Armor Value** |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Helmet (Primitive)                   | 2               |
| Helmet, Heavy (Ancient and Medieval) | 8               |
| Helmet, Light (Ancient and Medieval) | 4               |
| Helmet, Heavy (Modern)               | 8               |
| Helmet, Light (Modern)               | 6               |
| Helmet, Heavy (Advanced)             | 16              |
| Helmet, Light (Advanced)             | 14              |

**Shields**

Shields are basically large parrying weapons, designed to be interposed between your character and an attacker. A shield usually has a handle, strap, or straps and is worn on the non-weapon arm (for most people, the left arm). Traditionally, shields must compromise between toughness, lightness, and balance. Shields range in size from the small buckler (barely the size of a dinner plate) to the large shield used by Hoplite warriors.

Shields are categorized chronologically. In most cases, shields from an earlier period are available in later periods, so your gamemaster may simply choose where availability stops and allow your character access to shields prior to that point.

All shields are used in melee or to defend against missiles. A thrown shield is an improvised weapon with a range of 10 meters and a 05% chance to hit (this can increase with experience).

Each shield type has the following attributes:

-   **Name:** The common name for the shield.
-   **Base Chance:** The base chance for anyone picking up the shield. This base chance is also the beginning value for attacking with the shield.
-   **Skill:** The skill used for the shield.
-   **AV/HP:** This is the shield’s armor point value as well as its hit point value. This amount is used if the shield is damaged or targeted. See Slung Shields (following) for details.
-   **Damage:** The amount of damage the shield does if used as a weapon.
-   **Special:** The type of special success the shield does. Most shields do knockback special successes.
-   **Burden:** This describes the awkwardness or relative encumbrance of the shield.
-   **ENC:** (Optional) The ENC value of the shield.
-   **Locations:** (Optional) For hit locations, the hit locations covered by the shield. This is usually only appropriate for slung shields. See **Slung Shields**.
-   **STR/DEX:** The minimum STR and DEX required to use the shield. If your character does not meet the minimum required STR and DEX, any uses of the shield are Difficult.
-   **Value:** The shield’s cost in an appropriate setting.

Each shield type is described in **Shield Descriptions**.

**Slung Shields**

Usually shields are worn slung over the arm/shoulder or back when not being used actively in combat. If your gamemaster is using hit locations, add 1/2 the armor value of a slung shield (round up) to any hit location struck by a weapon, in addition to the armor value already in that location. Of the shields described in this section, only the buckler, primitive, and energy shields cannot be slung. As most shields have a high armor value, this negates most attacks.

**For example,** *your character has a shield slung over their back, and an opponent fires an arrow from behind. The attack is a success, and the hit location rolled indicates the torso. Your gamemaster rules that the shield covers this hit location, so ½ of the shield’s armor value is applied to the arrow’s damage. Your gamemaster tells you “The arrow thuds into the shield on your back, but it doesn’t get through.” Now your character has a chance to hold their shield properly, not trusting another lucky break.*

**Shield Descriptions**

This section describes all types of shields, organized alphabetically.

**Buckler:** A small shield that protects the lower part of the arm, usually held with a handgrip or single strap. These are worn on the belt (or swash), which gave rise to the term ‘swashbuckler’.

**Energy Shield:** A defensive device consisting of a small power pack mounted on the defender’s arm and a projector that emits a circular shield of variable size.

**Full Shield:** Larger than a small shield and of a variety of shapes, a full shield is usually large enough to cover the defender’s lower face and groin.

**Half Shield:** A smaller shield of a variety of shapes, commonly used by riders, archers, or light skirmishers (vs. heavy front-line fighters).

**Heater:** A medium shield shaped like a flatiron heater (and named for it). This is the traditional shape of many heraldic coats of arms.

**Hoplite:** A large rectangular shield, very protective, but too heavy and clumsy for horsemen. Hoplite shields are often used resting on the ground. Generally rectangular in shape, but some are oblong and with rounded edges.

**Kite:** A large, teardrop-shaped shield with a round top and pointed bottom, covering the body from shoulders to the knee or ankle.

**Large Round:** Identical to a round shield (below), only larger.

**Primitive:** A shield used in primitive warlike cultures. Usually nothing more than a wooden framework with stretched leather over it, wicker, stiffened cloth, or even extremely rigid animal hide.

**Round:** A round shield gripped inside the central boss. Unique in that it has thin unprotected edges which can be used to catch and break edged weapons with a special maneuver.

**Riot:** A large rectangular clear plastic shield used by riot policemen. Light and tough, these enable shield walls and provide adequate defense against most attackers.

**Spiked:** A type of target with a central spike, a blade, or series of small spikes facing outward at the opponent.

**Target:** A round, medium-sized shield, common in many cultures. Usually made with a metal rim.

**Artillery**

Artillery describes giant mechanisms, usually on the battlefield or in defense of an installation such as a castle, military base, or mounted on a vehicle. In ancient and medieval settings, artillery is primarily siege weaponry. Artillery weapons can be mounted on vehicles ranging in size from motorcycles, wagons, jeeps, up through battleships and space stations. These massive weapons are usually mounted and complex enough to require more than one operator. Most are ranged and fire projectiles. Traditionally, most deliver what is known as indirect fire, targeting an area rather than a specific object (a character or vehicle), though some can be used against individual targets.

There are nearly as many types of artillery weapons as there are hand-to-hand weapons, and this section covers a representative sampling. Larger weapons such as missiles, rockets, and vehicle-vs.-vehicle or vehicle-vs.-structure weapons are beyond the scope of these rules.

Each artillery weapon has the following attributes:

-   **Name:** The common name for the type of artillery weapon.
-   **Skill:** The skill used for this artillery weapon.
-   **Base:** The base chance to use the artillery weapon.
-   **Dmg:** The damage done by the artillery weapon, sometimes expressed as dice/meter. Damage reduces by 1D6 per meter beyond initial radius.
-   **Attk:** The number of attacks a round the artillery weapon allow.
-   **Special:** The type of special success.
-   **Rng:** The range of the siege weapon.
-   **Crew:** The number of characters the artillery weapon requires to be used effectively. Below this number, all attacks are *Difficult*.
-   **HP:** The artillery weapon’s hit points.
-   **AV:** The artillery weapon’s armor value, if applicable.
-   **Ammo:** The type of ammunition, whether solid, shrapnel, energy, chemical, or other?
-   **CAP:** The weapon’s capacity; how many shots it can fire before reloading or recharging.
-   **Mal:** The artillery weapon’s chance to malfunction.
-   **Value:** The weapon’s average cost in an appropriate setting.
-   **SIZ:** The artillery weapon’s SIZ.
-   **Rate:** The weapon’s rate of fire, defined as the number of rounds it takes to load and launch, such as 1/X, with X being the number of rounds.

Each artillery weapon is described in **Artillery Weapon Descriptions**.

**Artillery Weapon Classes**

These classes have some overlap, especially with the Heavy Weapons skill, and that skill may allow players to use artillery weapons as if *Difficult*, or vice versa.

-   **Cannon:** Cannon, energy cannon, field gun, howitzer, tank gun.
-   **Launcher:** Mortar.
-   **Mounted Gun:** Rail gun.
-   **Siege Engine:** Ballista, catapult, springald, trebuchet.
-   **Missile:** Torpedo.
-   **Turret:** Energy turret, flame turret, laser turret, missile turret, machinegun turret, shock turret, spear-thrower turret.

**Artillery Weapon Effects**

Artillery weapons are rarely used against individuals. They are fired at masses of men or at walls and other structures, usually affecting an area of SIZ 40 (around four meters in radius from the center, about the SIZ of a small airplane). Anyone caught in that range is injured. If a target is smaller than SIZ 40, reduce the chance of hitting by –1% per each point of SIZ point smaller than 40.

**For example,** *using an artillery weapon against a SIZ 14 person would result in a –26% reduction to the appropriate skill.*

If the projectile misses, use the rules for the Throw skill to determine where the projectile actually went, multiplying the distance by ×5.

**For example,** *if the Throw skill indicates that a projectile missed by four meters, multiply the result by ×5 for a result of 20 meters. This is to ensure that a miss is still a miss.*

**Guided Missiles**

Forms of artillery such as missiles are guided through internal or external electronic targeting systems, making them much more accurate. If a missile is guided in this manner, it makes any skill use *Easy*. If it is self-guided, it automatically strikes the target on any roll other than a 99 or 00, though a mobile target may attempt to dodge the missile. If so, dodging attempts are considered to be evasive actions, and dodges against a guided missile are Difficult, whether the Dodge, Drive, or Pilot skill is used.

The best defense against guided missiles (other than thick armor) is electronic jamming. Jamming makes a guided missile’s attack chance *Difficult*. If a guided missile misses its target, see the rules for artillery weapon misses (prior) to determine where the projectile actually strikes.

**Shrapnel**

Many artillery weapons can shoot projectiles that fragment, or large payloads of smaller projectiles. Both serve the same purpose—scattering sharp objects (shrapnel) across a radius around the point of impact. Some weapons only fire solid projectiles, others fire only shrapnel, and some can fire either type of payload.

Shrapnel damages everything in its blast radius, but generally does not cause major structural damage to buildings. Usually, damage from shrapnel is only 1/6 normal damage (divide the number of dice if possible, if not, roll and divide by 6, rounding up) by a comparable solid projectile, but it is done to everything within a radius equal in meters to the number of dice called for by the solid projectile damage roll.

**For example,** *a trebuchet fires a projectile doing 12D6 damage when it hits. If it fires shrapnel, it does 2D6 to everything within a 12-meter radius of the point of impact.*

**Artillery Weapon Descriptions**

Here is a sampling of artillery weapons, organized alphabetically.

**Arbalest, Siege:** A heavier version of the arbalest, reloaded with the aid of a cranequin.

**Ballista:** A large mounted siege weapon that throws crossbow-style bolts, usually at people on the battlefield rather than structures or other vehicles.

**Cannon:** A cannon fires solid projectiles such as shells, cannonballs, or smaller shot using an explosive charge contained within the base of the barrel. The older the cannon, the less sophisticated the projectile. Some pirates loaded cannons with chains to foul sails.

**Cannon, Energy:** A heavy-framed energy projection weapon, firing single blasts or using a rotating series of barrels for multiple fire. Usually mounted on starships or on bases, though some are portable.

**Catapult:** A siege weapon that hurls stones and other objects in a parabolic arc onto the targeted area. Because of the flight path of catapulted missiles, they are ideal for reaching over walls of open fortifications or shooting at slow-moving ground or sea vehicles.

**Gun, Field:** A smaller and more mobile cannon.

**Gun, Gatling:** The first rapidly repeating firearm. Too large to be carried, Gatling guns are mounted on wagons or two-wheeled caisson-like carts. Most modern machine guns descend from this initial design.

**Gun, Rail:** An immense gun utilizing a series of magnetic fields to propel a projectile along a rail, accelerating the projectile to incredible velocity.

**Gun, Tank:** The main weapon of a tank, firing high-velocity large caliber rounds from a variety of ammunition types. Some of the more common projectiles fired from tank guns are high explosive, armor piercing, or guided missiles.

**Howitzer:** A type of field artillery similar to the cannon, though with a shorter and narrower barrel. Howitzers fire projectiles at a higher angle and trajectory, delivering plunging fire (fire falling from above) at an enemy.

**Mortar:** A small rocket launcher based on the ground, firing a self-propelled bomb in a high arc at the target. These are often little more than a solid base and a tube with a simple firing mechanism.

**Springald:** Similar to the ballista in function, this siege weapon hurls immense javelins at a targeted area, but can also be used to throw stones or bolts. Bolts are launched in a direct trajectory and stones are thrown indirectly.

**Torpedo:** A self-propelled missile used underwater or in space, set to explode upon contact with the target. Older torpedoes were sometimes set off at a calculated distance to prevent them from becoming navigational hazards. More sophisticated models have guidance systems and the ability to lock on targets.

**Trebuchet:** This seesaw-like siege engine uses an immense counterweight to throw large stones or other payloads at the targeted area. Usually assembled on a battlefield, it only targets a single area, and the only means of changing the aim is to shorten the distance or move the entire trebuchet.

**Turret, Energy:** Used in space or on ground, an energy turret is a large energy-projecting weapon that draws an immense amount of power. Commonly used on space stations, medium-to-large spaceships, or in large ground battles. Otherwise similar to a machinegun turret (below).

**Turret, Flame:** A turret-mounted flamethrower, usually with additional armor protecting the user, offering greater range than a hand-held flame projector.

**Turret, Laser:** A turret-mounted laser cannon, often mounted on a space station or defensive satellite. Similar to an energy turret (above) but using lased light rather than raw energy bursts.

**Turret, Machinegun:** A large machine gun set on a rotating base, capable of a large arc of fire, usually guided either from afar or from an internal or external gunner. Turrets are usually mounted on medium or large airplanes, ships, tanks or other motor vehicles, or even on walls or other defensive structures.

**Turret, Shock:** A turret capable of projecting lightning or electric arcs across a distance, often utilizing some form of alternating current. A shock turret has a +20% to hit against a metallic target, or a target covered in metal armor.

**Turret, Spear-thrower:** A turret-mounted automatic spear-gun, usually firing meter-long metal bolts rather than actual spears. Some early models are used in the whaling industry, though they are also utilized in post-apocalyptic settings.

Notes:

1.  A Gatling gun fires a 36-round burst each combat round.
2.  This is a man-portable mortar. Larger versions are equivalent to howitzers.
3.  The SIZ is for the torpedo itself; it must be fired from a launch tube, usually a part of a submarine or other vessel.
4.  A standard machinegun turret fires a 120-round burst each combat round.
5.  If a target is struck, roll Luck. If the roll fails, they are on fire and take 1D6 points of damage immediately and every subsequent combat round until the fire is extinguished or otherwise neutralized (see **Fire and Heat**).
6.  Roll damage and pit it vs. the target’s CON in a resistance roll. If target loses, they are stunned for 1D3+1 rounds (see **Stunning**).

Notes:

1.  Damage is expressed in dice per meters; damage done per meter past the initial radius decreases by 1D6.
2.  All damaged targets must succeed with a Stamina roll or be stunned (see **Stunning**).
3.  Illuminates area of range instead of damage (see **Light Sources**).
4.  Fills area with toxic or non-toxic gas (see **Poisons**). A example gas grenade might have 2D6+12 POT, instant effect, and cause choking and 1D6 per round hit point loss if target fails a resistance roll vs. CON.
5.  Phosphorous grenades produce smoke and are also incendiary, causing damage each round until extinguished (see **Fire and Heat**).
6.  Fills an area with vision obscuring smoke instead of doing damage; can obscure a room as if darkened (see **Darkness**).
7.  If a target is struck, they must roll Luck. If the roll fails, they are on fire and take 1D6 points of damage immediately and every subsequent round until the fire is extinguished or neutralized (see **Fire and Heat**).

Notes:

1.  Damage is expressed in dice per meters; damage done each meter past the initial radius decreases by 1D per range increment.
2.  Damage is rolled and pitted vs. an electronic/electrical-based target’s CON or current hit points in the resistance roll. If the target loses, they suffer the rolled amount in damage. If the resistance roll is successful, target takes the detonator’s minimum damage (based on range) to current hit points.
3.  A struck target must make a *Difficult* Luck roll. If the roll fails, they are on fire and take 1D6 points of damage immediately and every subsequent round until the fire is extinguished or neutralized (see **Fire and Heat**).
4.  Against an nonliving target, damage is pitted vs. the target’s base CON, armor value, or hit points (gamemaster choice). If the target fails the roll, it shatters or is rendered non-functional.
5.  Roll damage and pit it vs. the target’s CON in a resistance roll. If the target succeeds, they take minimum damage (2) instead of the rolled damage. If the target loses, they are stunned for 1D3+1 rounds (see **Stunning**).

**Robots & Artificial Life**

One unique type of equipment is the **robot**, a construction treated like a character, with a similar range of characteristics and skills. Robots range in shape and design from non-humanoid golems, clumsy and oversized automatons, sleek and attractive humanoids, or even indistinguishable from humanity. For convenience, all types of robots (androids, golems, synthetic humanoids, A.I., etc.) are referred to as robots in these rules.

All the attributes for a robot are identical to a normal character’s, with the same characteristics, skills, and even powers. *Chapter 11: Creatures* has a sample robot.

**Robots as Player Characters**

With your gamemaster’s permission, your character can even be a robot, either built using normal character creation or using one of the samples as a template. If so, your character should be built along the lines of a normal character, though POW becomes a simple battery storage capability, rather than actual soul-force. The most appropriate power set for a robot is the superpowers system. Your character must either be repaired through an appropriate Repair skill (or Technical Skill, depending on how advanced your character is), and these repairs may require a Status roll to gain access to the required components.

**Cybernetics**

If you wish for your character to have some cybernetic aspects to their body, such as artificial limbs or organs, work with your gamemaster to determine what effects the artificial body part should have. In most cases, if the body part does not offer any special bonuses or unusual attributes, assume that it is to be treated just like a living body part, though instead of the First Aid skill, use an appropriate Repair or Technical Skill to restore the limb to functionality if it is damaged through the effects of a major wound or an injury from use of hit locations.

If you want the artificial body part to have some special powers or attributes beyond those of a normal limb, construct the limb as if it were a gadget (see **Equipment with Superpowers**), only attached intrinsically to your character’s body. Alternately, the artificial limb/organ could be removable or even modular. Either way, the gadget system is the best means of simulating cybernetic or otherwise artificial body parts.

**Metric Conversions**

*Basic Roleplaying* uses the metric system as its default. While most of the world uses the metric system, Imperial measurements are often used in historical settings, and you and your gamemaster may wish to use such measures for ease and/or flavor. The metric conversions below are approximate and rounded where convenient.

**Metric/imperial Equivalencies**

|                             |                     |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| 1 centimeter = 1/3 inch     | 0° C = 32° F        |
| 1/3 meter = 1 foot          | 10° C = 50° F       |
| 1 meter = 1 yard            | 20° C = 68° F       |
| 1 kilometer = 3/5 mile      | 30° C = 86° F       |
| 100 grams = 3 ounces        | 40° C = 104° F      |
| 1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds     | 100° C = 212° F     |
| 1 metric ton = 2,200 pounds | 200° C = 392° F     |
| 1 liter = 1 quart           | 500° C = 922° F     |
| 4 liters = 1 gallon         | 1,000° C = 1,832° F |

**Vehicles**

Just as with weapons and armor types, the following section includes a variety of vehicles listed in **Movement Rates**, as well as others suitable for adventuring. These abstract examples can help you and your gamemaster create additional types of vehicles, expanding or altering statistics as desired.

The following terms are used to define each vehicle:

-   **Type:** The generic type of vehicle.
-   **Skill:** The skill to use when piloting it.
-   **Rated Speed:** The maximum speed of the vehicle, an abstract value used in the chase system.
-   **Handling:** The modifier applied to your character’s skill, reflecting the vehicle’s maneuverability or relative ease of use.
-   **ACC:** Acceleration, the number of speed increments the vehicle can accelerate or decelerate from its current rated speed each combat round. This is provided as a value of ±, and is used in the vehicle chase system.
-   **MOV:** The maximum speed of the vehicle in a combat round, expressed in its MOV rating. MOV has a sliding value of 1–5 meters; this assumes a median value of 3.
-   **Armor:** The vehicle’s general armor value and protection it provides to crew or passengers. Usually, attacks on passengers are through a window or open section of the cabin. If these two numbers are different, they are expressed as two values separated by a slash. Your gamemaster should determine whether a character has protection from the vehicle. Attacking someone within a vehicle is *Difficult*.
-   **SIZ:** The vehicle’s apparent SIZ value.
-   **HP:** The vehicle’s hit points. Vehicles do not suffer the secondary effects of special successes, other than increased damage, and critical successes ignore the vehicle’s armor and do increased damage.
-   **Crew:** The number of characters required to pilot and maintain the vehicle at full efficiency while enroute. For larger vessels, this is usually 1/3 the normal complement, as the crews work in 8-hour shifts. Vehicle-related skill rolls may be *Difficult* if the vehicle is under-crewed.
-   **Passengers:** The number of passengers the vehicle normally carries, combined with the number of off-duty crewmembers (if appropriate).
-   **Cargo:** The space the vehicle has for cargo, expressed in SIZ. For game purposes, 1 ENC equals 1 SIZ point.
-   **Value:** A general value for the vehicle, as described in **Money** and **Purchasing Equipment**.
-   **Notes:** Additional notes about the vehicle and its capabilities.

**Books and Printed Materials**

This category covers a large variety of reading materials, ranging from newspapers, comics, scrolls, paperbacks, grimoires, or books. For convenience, they are referred to as books. Books can be for entertainment or for informational purposes. Only the latter type is addressed here. Books can have almost any value, from cheap to priceless, depending on the subject matter, date of publication, author, rarity, or other circumstances.

When a book is sought out or encountered, your gamemaster should determine the following:

-   **Language:** If the book is written in a language other than your character’s native tongue, they must have the book translated or make Language rolls as appropriate (or Literacy, if that skill is used).
-   **Skill:** Can your character learn to improve a skill with this book? Generally, a book contains a single skill, though rare and prized volumes may include more than one subject.
-   **Reward:** What bonus to a skill can be gained by reading the book? This is generally an amount from 1% for something brief or mostly filled with nonessential materials, up to 20% for a comprehensive volume that serves as the end-all authority on the subject. Generally, an amount between +1% and +10% is appropriate. If more than one skill can be learned from the book, your gamemaster should determine two ratings, even if they are identical.
-   **Time to Read:** How long does the book take to read? This represents a thorough examination of the text of the book and an attempt to understand it in context. This may involve additional supplementary reading, research, or analysis to increase comprehension and to master the material.
-   **Powers:** Some rare books contain magic or sorcery spells, invocations to demons or other supernatural beings, or some other means of learning a power. Your gamemaster should determine if the book has any of these, what they are, and how much can be learned (such as a level or percentage cap, if appropriate). In some works, the actual name of the power may be obscure or deliberately vague, to shield the contents from the neophyte. Refer to the guidelines in the magic and sorcery powers for learning spells. The book may have no spells, but include the true name of a demon, elemental, or even a god.

**Types of Books**

Following is a variety of book types, and how they can be used in play:

-   **Instructional Books:** A book meant to teach a particular subject or skill, organized and written with that goal. It is assumed that when your character is training by themselves, instructional books are being used as references. Instructional books, when read successfully, provide an experience check (see **Researching Skill Increases**), though your gamemaster may award a default skill increase.
-   **Lore Books:** A lore book contained specialized knowledge of the non-scientific sort, whether occult or folklore or some other ‘soft’ field. These vary tremendously in structure, but often give an impression of a specific field of knowledge from the author’s perspective, whether a scholarly overview or the private diary of a lunatic. Reading a lore book usually allows the reader to increase the skill(s) the book is centered around. These are similar to instructional books, though successful reading of a lore book grants an automatic increase of a skill rating. Your gamemaster may determine that books containing diabolical or horrific lore cause automatic sanity point loss without a sanity roll to prevent the loss. For books that increase a Knowledge skill and cost sanity points, your gamemaster should impose a limit on maximum SAN based on the total of 99 minus the skill rating in that skill, as described in the Blasphemous Knowledge skill description and **Maximum Sanity**.
-   **Reference Books:** A reference book can be a dictionary, encyclopedia, or another reference in paper, electronic, or some other format. The primary difference between a reference book and another type of book is that there is no attempt to contextualize the information—instead, it is presented in a non-hierarchical format, with all information at the same level. It is challenging to learn from a reference work without a frame of reference or context for its subject, but reading a reference work is an excellent means of augmenting another Knowledge skill. If a reference book is being used to research a skill for skill improvement, a successful roll is required to read the book, then the very skill being studied. The time required to research a skill though a reference book is double that of an instructional book. Successful skill rolls made to research or augment a skill increase do not earn an additional experience check.
-   **Spellbooks:** Also referred to as grimoires, these are books, scrolls, tablets, hides, scribed stones, knotted ropes, or other means used to convey the information required for a magician or sorcerer to learn magic spells or store spells they already know, or containing secret information about magical beings or demons. These spellbooks are described in the magic and sorcery powers in *Chapter 4: Powers*.

**Using a Book**

To use a book, your character must be able to read it or understand it if it is not written down. This may require the optional Literacy skill, if used, or a successful Language roll for the language(s) the book is written in. Alternatively, a translation can often be obtained, though this is costly if it must be done on commission. Your gamemaster should determine how much this would cost, using the guidelines for teachers given in **Skill Training Costs**. When the study of the book is complete, your character earns the relevant skill points, if any.

**Books as Objects**

The physical properties of books are usually less impressive than the contents. Most books are of SIZ 0, 1, or 2, and a book’s hit points equal its SIZ. Depending on what its made of, a book usually has an armor value of 0 (paperback) up to 4 points of armor (heavy leather spine and covers). A particularly old book can even be bound in iron (6+ armor value). Unless the book has some additional measure of protection or is sturdily constructed, it can be reduced to scraps or destroyed by fire in as many combat rounds as it has hit points. If the book is a scroll, electronic reading device, holographic learning display, or computer, your gamemaster should determine its SIZ and hit points based on examples of items in this chapter.

**Medical Equipment**

Physical harm is a constant threat to your character, and many pieces of equipment exist to assist in treating injuries and illness. The following medical equipment is listed in order of relative complexity, from the more primitive to futuristic. Each such collection of equipment is defined as a **kit**, an assortment of gear and materials used for a specific purpose. Your gamemaster can determine if a particular kit is of *inferior*, *average*, or *superior* quality, with relevant modifiers to the skill use.

-   **Herbalist or Midwife’s Kit:** Used by shamans, physikers, midwives, and leeches, this is an assortment of cloth for bandages, poultices, thread and a sharp needle (bone or metal), and some other oddments including herbal remedies of various levels of efficacy. Such a kit is cheap in most settings, and is often gathered by the owner using the Knowledge (Herbalism) skill.
-   **First Aid Kit:** A standard first aid kit includes setting-appropriate equivalents of clean (or sterile) bandages, rubber gloves, minor ointments, pills for minor illnesses or infections, eyewash, poison or venom treatment, and small tools such as tweezers, scissors, or even a small scalpel. Larger kits have a larger variety of the above, more various medicines, and may come with a small first aid manual. A first aid kit is used with the First Aid skill, and is usually cheap.
-   **Doctor’s Bag:** A traditional doctor’s bag includes a setting-appropriate assortment of pills and antibiotics, a stethoscope, light, a prescription pad, and various medical implements and tools for on-site diagnosis and emergency medical treatment. A doctor’s bag is used with the First Aid skill, but can be used for Medicine skill rolls depending on the procedure. A doctor’s bag is expensive.
-   **Surgery Kit:** A set of surgical tools packaged and sterile, ready for use. This contains several rubber gloves, dressings, antiseptics, sutures, etc., and is essential for any involved surgery or use of the Medicine skill involving surgery. Any hospital should have multiples of everything that goes into a surgery kit. A surgery kit is expensive.
-   **Trauma Kit:** A specialized collection of medical supplies to deal with immediate trauma. Often intended for battlefield use, a trauma kit has supplies such as adrenalin shots, antitoxins, other remedies to ward against chemical agents, emergency medical supplies to immediately deal with large and open wounds, a portable defibrillator, and a limited set of surgical tools. A trauma kit is expensive.
-   **Medi-kit:** A highly advanced set of equipment, this includes dermal regenerators, hypo-sprays, instant blood clotting agents, a simple medical scanner, universal anti-toxins and antidotes, stimulation shots, synthetic skin spray, spray-on casts and other forms of instant wound sealing. Usually a medi-kit has a small medical computer or reader capable of describing thousands of treatments and diagnosing simple injuries. Use of a medi-kit makes all First Aid attempts *Easy*, and doubles the number of hit points a successful First Aid roll heals. If it is available in your setting, a medi-kit is expensive.
-   **Auto-doc:** A fully automated medical treatment system complete with complex diagnostic abilities capable of recognizing and implementing treatment for almost any known medical condition. Auto-docs may include robotic components capable of maneuvering patients, or can be the size of a room, extruding limbs and other manipulators to interact with the patient on a central bed. An auto-doc has 100% skill in Medicine and First Aid, and a successful roll restores double the number of hit points to the patient, with recovery times cut in half. An auto-doc is expensive or priceless, while treatment in one ranges from free to priceless.

**Other Equipment**

Following are other useful types of gear that your character might wish to utilize. **Skills and Equipment** contains more detail on equipment required for or assisting in skill use.

-   **Chemistry Set:** A wide selection of small portions of chemicals and substances, with a microscope and means of mixing and storing compounds. Usually only an educational tool, it can be utilized with the Science (Chemistry) skill for basic tasks. Cheap and readily available to students or anyone else interested.
-   **Computers:** Depending on the setting, a computer is either a simple (recalls information when queried and performs simple commands) or complex (possessing artificial intelligence or an approximation of sentience) tool that can be used along with other skills such as Appraise, Art, Gaming, Knowledge, Science, Teach, and especially Research. Any skill that benefits from a wide and searchable base of knowledge or near-instant communication with others in the field can benefit from using a computer. The programs contained or accessible and relative ease of use allow a bonus of up to +20% if the computer is suitable for the skill being used; an average computer setup offers no bonus; and an inferior or inefficient computer setup can penalize a skill by up to –20%. If you and your gamemaster wish for the computer to have more capability than a period-appropriate computer, create it as a superpowered gadget with INT.
-   **Criminology Kit.** Used by forensics labs and detectives, a criminology kit contains fingerprint detection methods, measuring devices, rubber gloves, collection bags and bottles for storage of evidence, magnifying glasses, appropriate chemicals and sprays, minor tools, black-light and normal flashlights, and other means of detecting traces of criminal activity. A criminology kit is expensive.
-   **Disguise Kit.** A collection of skin dyes and colors, makeup, and other means to change one’s appearance, a disguise kit is usually assembled by the user to be of maximum use for their physical features and/or gender. A disguise kit may include wigs, false teeth, false facial hair, hair dyes and other styling tools, scissors, a mirror, false contact lenses or glasses, and even pieces of wardrobe. More sophisticated kits can include prosthetics to alter facial features. A disguise kit can also be general-purpose, but such a kit is not usually as effective. One can be assembled out of commercially-available items for cheap to average cost, or a high-quality one can be expensive.
-   **Kits, Various:** As described in **Skills and Equipment**, nearly any type of Craft skill can have a kit or tool set that aids in its use. The value and utility of these should be determined by your gamemaster based on the setting.
-   **Lockpicks.** This can range from a few single picks to a more sophisticated set with stethoscope, drills, and a variety of tools and implements for opening the most complex and challenging locks. These can range from cheap to expensive.
-   **Suppressors and Silencers.** A silencer is a long tube filled with baffles, attached to the barrel of a firearm, which muffles the sound of shots fired. This slows the projectile’s velocity, halving its base range. A silencer is usually made to order for a specific type of firearm, and usually wears out after D100+10 shots have been fired through it. A silencer cannot be attached to a shotgun or heavy machinegun, but can be used for a light or medium machinegun. In most settings they exist in, silencers are expensive and restricted.
-   **Telescopic Scopes and Laser Sights.** These attach to a firearm and allow your character to effectively double the base range. Laser sights quadruple the base range. When combined with **Aimed Attacks**, either can be quite effective. These are of average value, though precision scopes may be more expensive.

**Mecha**

A mecha (sometimes shortened to ‘mech’) is essentially an overlarge suit of powered armor, piloted by one or more characters, usually humanoid or some bipedal structure in form, popular in science fiction settings. The example mecha depicted below was built using the superpowered gadget guidelines.

**Model D142 Mobile Exoframe, a.k.a. ‘Skyhammer’**

**Value:** Priceless

The Skyhammer is a heavily-armored, humanoid-shaped mecha with an elongated torso that serves as the cockpit, housing the pilot. Its head is an array of sensory equipment, and its limbs are functional. Protruding from its ‘navel’ is a large laser cannon that the pilot sits above.

**Skills:** Fine Manipulation 45%, Jump 65%, Listen 65%, Navigate 70%, Pilot (autopilot self) 41%, Repair (internal diagnostics and repair) 55%, Spot 65%, Track 30%, Fly 100%.

**Powers:** Adaptation 6 (cold, heat, high pressure, radiation, vacuum; cost = 15 points); Armor 30 (electric 30, kinetic 30, radiation 30; cost = 90 points); Energy Projection 5 (light; cost = 50 points); Extra Energy 11 (+110 power points; cost = 11 points); Flight 17 (cost = 17 points); Super Characteristics 200 (STR, CON, SIZ; cost = 200 points); Super Sense 5 (Hearing 5, Vision 5, Dark Vision 5, Infrared Vision 5, Sonar Detection 5; cost = 75 points); Super Skill (Fine Manipulation 2, Jump 2, Listen 2, Navigate 3, Pilot 2, Repair 2, Spot 2, Track 1, Fly 5; cost = 42 points).  
 Total Power Budget Cost = 500 points.

**General Qualities of Objects**

Other than weapons, armor, shields, siege weapons, vehicles, books, kits, etc. any other material object can be described as an object. This is a category covers telephones or telephone poles, houses or castles, ballpoint pens or the Eiffel Tower. Generally, the only reason to provide an attribute for an object is when it is being used against your character, your character is using it against another character, your character is trying to destroy it, or it is in the way (and potentially collateral damage).

**Damage to Inanimate Objects**

Inanimate objects such as doors, chairs, and walls are likely to interfere with a missed attack, or may need to be knocked down or blown apart. Your gamemaster should consult the SIZ values for sample items and use SIZ an object’s hit points, assigning an armor value based on its equivalent (see **Armor Protection**). If the damage exceeds the object’s armor value, then the hit points are reduced by the remaining damage and that many damage points reduce its armor value (representing how much less it is able to withstand damage once damaged). If an object is smaller than human-sized (such as a chair), it is totally destroyed if it is reduced to 0 hit points. It if is larger than human-sized (such as a wooden wall) and a section is reduced to 0 hit points; it has a human-sized hole in it.

**Armor Value of Substances**

Armor value represents the amount of damage subtracted from a successful attack. The higher the armor value of an object, the less likely it is to be damaged. Using values for other equipment or below, your gamemaster should be able to extrapolate additional armor values or estimate them based on rough equivalencies. Following are the armor values of various substances:

| **Type of Substance**     | **Armor Value** |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| 1 cm of glass             | 1               |
| 5 cm thick door           | 3               |
| 3 cm of hardwood          | 6               |
| 12 cm of concrete         | 9               |
| 3 cm of bulletproof glass | 22              |
| 3 cm of steel plate       | 28              |
| Large sandbag             | 20              |

Natural armor values such as these above are not lost and do not deteriorate through multiple attacks, unless through some environmental means or a specific attempt to reduce the armor value of an object.

**For example,** y*our character bashes at a window made of bulletproof glass repeatedly with a sledgehammer, aiming at the same spot in an attempt to cause enough cracking to break through it. You your gamemaster decides to represent this by reducing the armor value by 1 with each successful hit, and rolling damage. When the damage roll overcomes the steadily reducing armor value, the window bursts.*

A simple guideline for destroying objects is that an average object has hit points roughly equivalent to its SIZ, and once armor is bypassed and these hit points are lost, the object is nonfunctional and destroyed, or at least reduced to a state where it is of no apparent use.

**SIZ of Common Objects**

Nearby is a list of sample sizes of various objects. ‘Full’ represents the entire size of the object as used for lifting or determining its hit points, and ‘Segment’ represents a human-sized portion of the object, for purposes of breaking through or destroying a section for passage through. If the damage done to an object does not exceed the object segment’s SIZ, a hole may have been broken through the size and shape of the attack, as appropriate. As noted above, an average object is assumed to have hit points equal to its SIZ.

**Comparative Sizes**

This table equates approximate weight with game SIZ. In Basic Roleplaying, SIZ pertains not only to weight but to volume and height as well. This table is not precise or restrictive: you should use judgment when assigning SIZ and weight based on the makeup of the item or creature. From SIZ 330 on, SIZ is roughly 1/10th the item or creature’s weight in short tons.

**For example**, *a kraken of SIZ 8,000 weighs 80,000 short tons.*

| **SIZ** | **Imperial Weight** | **Metric Weight**     |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| 1       | 1–12 pounds         | 0.5–5.5 kilograms     |
| 4       | 38–51 pounds        | 17–23 kilograms       |
| 8       | 109–120 pounds      | 50–55 kilograms       |
| 12      | 156–168 pounds      | 71–76 kilograms       |
| 16      | 220–239 pounds      | 100–109 kilograms     |
| 20      | 310–338 pounds      | 141–154 kilograms     |
| 24      | 440–479 pounds      | 200–218 kilograms     |
